      <description>It’s about time I followed my goals. My job is fine – I work as a content editor, managing a local authority website – but would I be happy doing that forever? No.
I’m good at it and it pays the bills, but I don’t feel that buzz I’m always told you’re meant to feel. I never knew what I wanted to be growing up, but I’m starting to realise web development is for me.</description>

      <description>I’m 31. I work full-time in web content, but it doesn’t give me that buzz I’m looking for. Instead, I want to learn web development. My mind works in a logical way and I like to make sure things, just, work..
I set up this site to track my progress – or keep myself in check. Probably the latter, if I’m honest. Certainly not to procrastinate – no way. I’m a writer by nature and experience, so by noting down my problems, my successes, my goals, I think I’ll help my learning.</description>
