It’s about time I followed my goals. My job is fine – I work as a content editor, managing a local authority website – but would I be happy doing that forever? No.

I’m good at it and it pays the bills, but I don’t feel that buzz I’m always told you’re meant to feel. I never knew what I wanted to be growing up, but I’m starting to realise web development is for me. [At 31 it’s late, but not too late to set my career to a new path](/about "About me").

## Why coding?

The short answer is I think it suits me and the way my mind works. A (slightly) longer answer is that there has always been an interest, a curiosity as to how it all works, bubbling under the surface and the time is right to see what that’s all about.

In my teens, I used to make little wrestling-based decision games in what I seem to remember as C. Looking back, I should have developed (see what I did there?) this further but at that age I wasn’t thinking about jobs and bills and adult stuff, so I didn’t. That’s what I’m using to justify waiting until 31, anyway.

## What’s the plan?

My research of how to learn to code started on Reddit – the place most good ideas come from for people of my generation.

Then I got into a loop of looking for the best resources. Should I do a course on Udemy? Should I follow the OSSU computer science course? What about pure web development and something like The Odin Project? Or a paid boot camp? No, not that last one – I told you I had bills to pay and not much time, didn’t I?

I’ll go into more about what I’ve tried and where I’ve got to in a future blog. For now, know that I’ve decided to go with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/ "The Odin Project"). It involves self-study, commitment, fighting through concepts I don’t really get, but ultimately a real feeling of excitement when something clicks and a bit of code genuinely works.

> blog to keep me
> on track."

I owe it to myself to stick to one course and to see it through. By the end of 2019 I want to have been offered a job in web development. Piece of cake, right?

## And this blog?

Sadly I’m someone who adores procrastination, who needs to battle inner demons to stay on track. Once I’m focused I get in the zone, but that [instant gratification monkey](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html "Why procrastinators procrastinate") is never far away.

This will be a long and difficult road, I’m aware. So I’ve started this blog to:

+ keep me on track
+ set myself targets – if I tell the world (or the person who accidentally clicks on my blog) then I can’t let them down, can I?
+ brag about successes
+ moan about difficulties
+ write things down in order for it to sink in
+ other reasons I can’t think of right now, but certainly not to procrastinate and distract me from the actual coding work…

I hope some might follow me on this journey. Welcome.
