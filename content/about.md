I’m 31. I work full-time in web content, but it doesn’t give me that buzz I’m looking for. Instead, I want to learn web development. My mind works in a logical way and I like to make sure things, just, work..

I set up this site to track my progress – or keep myself in check. Probably the latter, if I’m honest. Certainly not to procrastinate – no way. I’m a writer by nature and experience, so by noting down my problems, my successes, my goals, I think I’ll help my learning.

I’m following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/ "The Odin Project"). Don’t ask how many avenues I’ve looked at to this point. My aim: be offered a job in web development by the end of 2019.
